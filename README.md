# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is one of the first programs I wrote when I first learned to code in Ruby and so in order to learn JavaScript I'm writing it again... in JavaScript!

```
The code will display an output from 1 to 100
On a number divisible by 3 it will display a "Fizz"
On a number divisible by 5 it will display "Buzz"
On a number divisible by 3 & 5 it will display "FizzBuzz"
```
